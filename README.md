# BEZAL Frontend

A web forum for digital creators to share their work, collaborate with other creators, and monetize their posts. This platform allows users to showcase their projects, share knowledge, and engage in meaningful discussions with like-minded individuals. I incorporated features like user profiles, real time messaging and notifications, post monetization, creating a seamless experience for the digital creator community.

This is the frontend application for BEZAL social media.
